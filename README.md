How to get started:

- clone the code to your local machine
- navigate to the directory
- make sure all the dependencies in requirements.txt are met (easy to use a venv)
  - run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
- give the script executable permission (chmod +x manhattan.py)

Run the script like this:
`./manhattan.py <x1> <y1> <x2> <y2>`

Example:
`./manhattan.py 5 4 3 2`
>>> Distance between A and B is 4
